# Jio Recharges API

This project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Jio recharges dataset and a FastAPI-based API to interact with the analyzed data. 

### Project Structure

- **`graphs.ipynb`**: Contains visualizations such as bar graphs and other plots that represent insights from the Jio recharges dataset.
- **`functions.py`**: Contains functions for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Jio recharges dataset, which are imported and used by the FastAPI application to generate various data insights.
- **`app.py`**: Main FastAPI application file.

### Features

- **EDA**: Analyze the Jio recharges dataset to understand key metrics and trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations such as bar graphs and other plots that give insights into the data.
- **FastAPI API**: Provides endpoints to access various statistics and insights derived from the data.
